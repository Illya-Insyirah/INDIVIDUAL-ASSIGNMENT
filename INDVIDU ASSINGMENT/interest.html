        <h2>Going Seventeen</h2>
        <p>One of my biggest comfort shows is Going Seventeen. Whenever I feel tired, stressed, or just need a good laugh, 
		this show is always my go-to. Watching the members joke around, laugh, and be themselves instantly lifts my mood 
		and makes everything feel lighter.Going Seventeen isn’t just entertaining, but comforting in its own way. It feels
		like a safe space where I can relax, forget about my worries for a while, and just enjoy the moment.</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="netball.jpg">
      <img src="netball.jpg" alt="sport" width="600" height="400">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">Netball is one of the sports I enjoy playing. It has taught me teamwork, discipline, and how to stay focused during games.
	Playing netball also gives me a chance to challenge myself and grow both physically and mentally. The photo shown here was taken during the 
	latest game I played at Sukol 2025, where my team and I managed to secure second place. It was a meaningful experience for me and a moment I’m really proud of.</div>

    <a target="_blank" href="matcha.jpg">
      <img src="matcha.jpg" alt="drink" width="600" height="400">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">Matcha is one of my favourite drinks, and I really enjoy its earthy, slightly bitter taste. It feels refreshing and different compared to
	my usual drink choices. Over time, matcha has become something I often go for, whether I’m taking a short break or simply enjoying a quiet moment during the day. 
	It’s a simple thing, but one that I genuinely enjoy.</div>

    <a target="_blank" href="au.jpg">
      <img src="au.jpg" alt="bumi" width="600" height="400">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">One of my interests is reading alternative universe (AU) stories on Twitter. I enjoy how these stories explore different perspectives, emotions, 
	and realities through creative storytelling. Among all the AUs I’ve read, Bumi dan Lukanya is one of my favourites because it gave me the biggest impact in my life.
	The story stayed with me long after I finished reading it, making me reflect on emotions, growth, and the meaning behind every chapter. It’s more than just a story to
	me, it’s something that left a lasting impression on my heart.</div>

    <a target="_blank" href="cat.jpg">
      <img src="cat.jpg" alt="kucing" width="600" height="400">
    </a>
    <div class="desc">Other than that, my interests is taking photos of cats. I enjoy capturing their cute expressions, random moments, and natural behaviours. 
	Every cat has its own personality, and photographing them feels like a fun way to appreciate those small details. It also allows me to slow down and enjoy 
	the moment, turning simple encounters with cats into something meaningful and memorable.</div>
